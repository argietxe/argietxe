### Argitxu Etchebarne *(she/her)*
#### Data analytics, information design & data visualization
Hello, my name is Argi ! 

I am a Data Analyst and Creative Designer based in Berlin, Germany. My background spans diverse fields including design research, visual arts, and set design, which has honed my ability to think critically and creatively. I've recently shifted my focus to data analysis, where I combine my analytical skills with my artistic sensibilities to create engaging and informative visualizations.

My experience includes mapping out regions, creating interactive digital platforms, and working with local communities to uncover and share stories. My passion lies in using data to uncover patterns, analyze trends, and communicate insights clearly through interactive dashboards and real-time data visualizations. I love working in teams, fostering a collaborative and positive atmosphere, and I bring a proactive and logical approach to every project. My strong communication skills, developed through my artistic and design projects, enable me to effectively convey complex data in a visually compelling manner.\
